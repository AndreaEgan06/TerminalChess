# Terminal Chess

This is a project I developed over the course of 2 weeks in late January/early February of 2024.
I originally wrote it inside a single c file, with the goals of: 
- minimizing lines of code/being efficient
- maximizing space efficiency
- implementing the rules of chess correctly

This project was meant to be a fun challenge for myself at the time.
I had basic knowledge of c, limited knowledge of OOP, a good understanding of chess rules, and no idea how to parse chess moves from [Algebraic notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)).
It's not representative of my current skills, since if I were to redo it now I would:
- Focus less on space efficiency and more on code readability/documentation
- Split functionality into different header files
- Adhere more to OOP principles

## Future plans

I plan to refactor this project in the near future, and maybe add some more features like a single-player mode against a chess engine.
